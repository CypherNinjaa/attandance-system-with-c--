📝 Overview:
Build a simple and functional Attendance Management System that allows admins/faculty to mark attendance, and students to view their records. The frontend should be a responsive web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The backend logic, including data processing and file/database management, will be handled by C++.

🔧 Functional Requirements:
📌 User Roles:
Admin / Faculty:

Login with ID and password.

View list of students.

Mark attendance for each student.

View attendance records.

Edit or delete attendance entries.

Student:

Login with student ID.

View their own attendance report.

🖥️ Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):
Login Page (for Admin/Faculty and Student)

Dashboard Page:

If Admin: show list of students + mark attendance form.

If Student: show attendance summary (present/absent, total %, etc.)

Attendance Form:

Table format with date, student name, checkboxes (present/absent).

Style:

Use CSS to create a clean, responsive layout.

Highlight today’s date, color-coded status (Present: Green, Absent: Red).

🧠 Backend (C++):
Use C++ to:

Handle login verification.

Store attendance records in a text file or simple local database (like SQLite if allowed).

Read/write/update student records.

Return data in JSON or text format to frontend via a CGI (Common Gateway Interface) or a custom lightweight server.

C++ Tasks:
Authentication Module: validate login using stored credentials.

Attendance Handler:

Save new attendance entries.

Fetch attendance for a student or whole class.

File Handling: store data in structured format (CSV, JSON, or SQLite).

Data API Simulation: use CGI to return JSON responses to JavaScript frontend.

🔄 Frontend-Backend Communication:
Since C++ is backend:

Use AJAX (JavaScript fetch API) to make HTTP requests to .cgi files (C++ compiled executables).

The server should be configured to run C++ code as CGI scripts (e.g., Apache + CGI module, or WSL/localhost setup).

Example:

js
Copy
Edit
fetch('/mark_attendance.cgi', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ student_id: "S101", date: "2025-08-02", status: "Present" })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
